# AKS-Upgrade-Doctor
AKS Upgrade Doctor is a client side tool designed to help customers identify and detect possible issues(through warnings) that would cause upgrade operations to fail on AKS clusters. 
This project was created as part of Microsoft's annual global hackathon and is currently in a beta state. 

# Goals
-Create a self-help diagnostic tool that will warn customers of incorrect Kubernetes cluster configurations before they try to upgrade
-Reduce number of clusters that get stuck in a failure state, resulting in a negative impact to the end customer
-Allow for addition of new rule set via rules at engine

# Scope 
This hackathon project focuses primarily on upgrade related issues although there is a protenial for the tool to evolve in the future.The first problem we are tackling is detection of restrictive PDBs configured on AKS cluster that would cause an upgrade operation to fail. Out of scope is detection of other issues.

# Implementation
Inspired by [kube-bench](https://github.com/aquasecurity/kube-bench), this project is implemented as rule engine in Go lang and separates : ​

*Definitions of the rules we need to check or detect.​

*Giving visual feedback of progress.​

*Structure and display of the results.

This implementation provides an extensible architecture which allows for the addition of further rules with minimal effort. Rule definitions can currently encompass anything that can be achieved with kubectl and [ARM API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/resources/) calls.
